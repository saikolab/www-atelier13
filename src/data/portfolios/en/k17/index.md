A 1982 penthouse in the city was radically redesigned and renovated for comfort, immediacy, energy efficiency, and modernization. We improved the layout, added warm neutral tones and natural materials, and incorporated hidden storage spaces. The result: a bright, cozy space that feels larger and more personal.
